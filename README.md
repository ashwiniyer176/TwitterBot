# TwitterBot - Automate your Twitter presence

The goal of the project is to build a bot that does all the hard work of maintaining a Twitter presence as you lay back with a cup of coffee and a stack of books to read. The bot is built using `tweepy` package for handling the Twitter API and `django` for the backend logic 

## Usage

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Doing this in a virtual environment is recommended)
2. `python manage.py runserver`

## Tasks 
1. Add auth and twitter connectivity
2. Check if message already exists
3. Write test cases for bot
4. Improve UI
